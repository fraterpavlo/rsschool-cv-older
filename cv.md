#Hello World

my name is *Shukan Pavel*, I am *21* years old and I live in *Minsk*.

##about me
I am a young, ambitious guy who wants to become better and make my life better. *I am sociable, cheerful and open to everything new.* 
I was educated working in the field of electronics, but now I want to change my profession and try myself in something new. 
I study at the Radio Engineering University, one of the best universities in Minsk. I want to learn programming and gain new knowledge and experience. 
for this I signed up for the "rsschool" courses. it is a very difficult field and the courses are very intensive, but I want to achieve my goal, even if I have to start all over again.

##my programming skills
now I have no professional programming skills. I figured out **html** and **css**, learned a little the programming language **javascript** and want to move on in this direction. 
I believe that I can do it.


##code examples
I already wrote my code when *I made a page* with my CV, as well as when *I wrote my own calculator in javascript*.
now I continue to study at BSUIR University, and in a month I will start studying at rsschool.

```
 <script>
                function insert (num) {
                    document.form.textview.value = document.form.textview.value + num 
                }

                function back() {
                    let str = document.form.textview.value

                    document.form.textview.value = str.substring(0, str.length-1);
                }

                function clean() {
                    document.form.textview.value = ""
                }

                function equal() {
                    let str = document.form.textview.value;

                    if(str) {
                        document.form.textview.value = eval(str)
                    }
                }
            </script>
            ```

##my English
I speak English at an elementary level. studied it at school. English is very important, so I plan to learn it along with programming. 
>because this will be an excellent advantage, and often even a necessity.
